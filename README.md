# Local ancestry-aware analysis between genetic variants within the progranulin gene and Alzheimers Disease

This repository contains the code used to conduct a local ancestry-aware association analyses between genetic variants within the progranulin gene and Alzheimers Disease. This analysis was performed using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). 

This analysis was conducted as part of a research project aimed at understanding the genetic factors contributing to Alzheimer's Disease, with a specific focus on the progranulin gene (GRN). The analysis takes into account local ancestry information to improve the accuracy of association results.

## Repository Structure

- `source/`: Contains the R script used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- `results/`: Contains the output files generated from the analysis. 

The results of this analysis are described in the Life B & Navarro-Delgado EI, et al. (2025) manuscript, which has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.
